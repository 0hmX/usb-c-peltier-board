# RP2040 USB control and firmware

The board has **PD IN** for Peltier power and **PROGRAM** for configuration and firmware updates. PROGRAM can power the logic by itself; it cannot energize the Peltier without qualified PD power. There is no screen or button UI.

The application uses the **official Raspberry Pi Pico SDK 2.2.0** and its pinned **TinyUSB 0.18.0** submodule, running only on RP2040 core 0. A 12 MHz crystal supplies the SDK's system/USB clocks. External flash is **Winbond W25Q128JVSIQ, 16 MiB**; SDK `boot2_w25q080` uses the compatible Winbond quad command set. The PCB remains unrouted: USB enumeration, actual flash programming, and converter operation await bench validation.

## Configure once, then use PD alone

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r host/requirements.txt
.venv/bin/python host/control.py configure 12.0 5.5
```

This sends STOP → SET → SAVE, storing the nominal **12 V / 5.5 A** TEC1-12706 profile. A later PD connection starts the saved profile after approximately one second of stable qualified input. Add `--run` to start now when PD is already connected. Unplugging PROGRAM leaves an operating output running on PD.

```sh
.venv/bin/python host/control.py configure 12.0 5.5 --run
.venv/bin/python host/control.py status
.venv/bin/python host/control.py stop
.venv/bin/python host/control.py run
```

The host tool selects a single connected driver and checks its STATUS response before sending control commands. Use `--port /dev/cu.usbmodem…` or `--port COM…` before the command when needed. Any serial terminal also works with newline-terminated commands; CDC does not depend on the selected baud rate.

| Command | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `SET 12000 5500` | Set millivolts and milliamperes atomically, only while OFF |
| `SAVE` | Save the current profile only while OFF; acknowledge only after flash readback |
| `RUN` | Start after full PD, limit, and register checks |
| `STOP` | Stop and cancel pending automatic start for this PD connection |
| `STATUS` | JSON run/CC/PD/fault, limits, approximate readings, saved-profile validity, and `boot_ready` |
| `CLEAR` | Stay OFF and clear the protective fault latch |
| `BOOT` | Disable output, then enter the built-in RP2040 USB BOOTSEL loader |

Limits are **2.1–15 V in 0.1 V steps**, **0.50–6.00 A in 0.05 A steps**, and **72 W maximum nominal**. Invalid inputs, integer overflow, unsupported steps, and excessive power are rejected without changing settings. The default is 12 V / 5.5 A, **OFF until a valid profile has been saved or RUN is requested**.

A source interruption shorter than one second stops output and requires RUN. After PD has been absent for at least one second, a new qualified connection can start the saved profile. SC/OVP, ADC, converter communication, and excessive measured-limit faults latch OFF; they cannot automatically retry. CLEAR stays OFF, while an explicit RUN retries all checks and clears the latch only after success. The protective latch survives application watchdog/reboot resets in scratch register 2. A power/RUN hardware reset may clear the retained register and is an intentional new power session.

POWER indicates logic supply, RUN indicates enabled output, and FAULT indicates a latched fault. Normal current limiting is permitted (`cc=1`). Voltage is regulated before the 10 mΩ shunt, so load voltage is approximately 10 mV lower per ampere.

RP2040 has no factory VREFINT calibration equivalent. Conversions explicitly assume **3300 mV ADC_AVDD**; LDO, filter, ADC, shunt, and divider tolerances make readings approximate. Measure ADC_AVDD and change `PD_ADC_REFERENCE_MV` if calibration is needed. Current limiting itself uses the converter's analog loop. PD eligibility uses an approximate 18–22 V reading plus the standalone PD fault and hardware UVLO protections. PROGRAM attachment uses its ADC3 reading with **4.2 V attach / 3.8 V detach** hysteresis, so a self-powered board keeps D+ disconnected when PROGRAM VBUS is absent.

## Saved profile and flash safety

SAVE writes a versioned, CRC32-checked 16-byte record in the final **4 KiB sector**, offset `0x00FFF000` / XIP address `0x10FFF000`. The linker excludes that sector from the application. Runtime JEDEC identification requires **EF 40 18**, matching the selected Winbond 16 MiB device, before loading or saving a profile.

Output permission goes LOW before a write. Core 1 is never launched. Core 0 interrupts are disabled while official SDK RAM-resident erase/program routines suspend XIP; one 4 KiB sector is erased and one full 256-byte page is programmed. XIP is restored before whole-page/CRC readback. SAVE returns OK only when readback matches. An identical saved profile skips erasure, and no automatic flash writes occur. Interrupted or invalid records cannot start output.

The watchdog is refreshed immediately before and after the critical section. Its 500 ms window exceeds the selected flash's specified maximum 400 ms sector erase plus 3 ms page program, with margin. Defective hardware can still reset during a write; output remains disabled and an incomplete profile is rejected. Qualify power-loss and flash timing behavior on hardware before release.

## Build

A GNU Arm Embedded toolchain providing `arm-none-eabi-gcc` is required. The verified build uses GCC 12.3.1 and CMake 3.31.6. Put the compiler on PATH or pass `-DPICO_TOOLCHAIN_PATH=/path/to/toolchain` to CMake. SDK dependencies stay outside the tracked repository:

```sh
git clone --depth 1 --branch 2.2.0 https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk.git ../../pico-sdk
git -C ../../pico-sdk submodule update --init --depth 1 lib/tinyusb
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
.venv/bin/cmake -S . -B build -DPICO_SDK_PATH="$(pwd)/../../pico-sdk"
.venv/bin/cmake --build build -j
```

The pinned SDK commit is `a1438dff1d38bd9c65dbd693f0e5db4b9ae91779`; TinyUSB is `86ad6e56c1700e85f1c5678607a762cfe3aa2f47`. The SDK fetches its official picotool when needed for UF2 generation. Outputs are **`build/general_pd.uf2`**, `general_pd.bin`, and `general_pd.elf`. The linker derives from the official SDK map and limits application flash to `0x00FFF000` bytes, leaving the last sector reserved.

Native checks:

```sh
mkdir -p build/native
cc -std=c11 -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Iinclude src/policy.c src/command.c test/policy_test.c -o build/native/policy-test
build/native/policy-test
cc -std=c11 -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Iinclude src/policy.c src/profile.c src/session.c test/profile_session_test.c -o build/native/profile-session-test
build/native/profile-session-test
python3 -m unittest discover -s host -p 'test_*.py'
python3 test/check_uf2.py build/general_pd.uf2
```

## USB programming and recovery

A blank RP2040/flash combination enters its ROM USB loader. Connect PROGRAM and copy **`general_pd.uf2`** onto the **RPI-RP2** USB drive. The ROM verifies/programs the UF2 and restarts the application. Later, `.venv/bin/python host/control.py boot` disables the converter and re-enters the same loader. Copy an updated UF2 to the drive. The generated UF2 does not include the reserved profile sector; a full flash erase intentionally removes saved settings.

If the application cannot respond, short the **BOOTSEL** test pad to **GND** while releasing **MCU_RUN** reset or powering PROGRAM. This holds QSPI chip-select LOW through its 1k isolation resistor at reset. Release BOOTSEL when RPI-RP2 appears. SWDIO, SWCLK, MCU_RUN, 3V3-reference, and GND pads also support a Raspberry Pi Debug Probe or compatible SWD probe. Recovery pads are fitted copper features rather than buttons.

BOOT acknowledges over CDC, keeps GPIO2 permission LOW, disables the application watchdog, and calls the official `reset_usb_boot(0, 0)` ROM API. Activity mask 0 permits no ROM activity GPIO, so programming cannot toggle output permission. Scratch 0/1 are reserved for ROM USB arguments and scratch 4–7 for SDK/ROM reboot conventions; the application retains faults in scratch 2. `watchdog_enable_caused_reboot()` distinguishes actual application watchdog expiration from intentional USB/UF2 restart. An existing protective latch remains until CLEAR, successful RUN, or a full hardware reset.

## GPIO contract

The build's custom board header is `include/general_pd_rp2040.h`.

| Signal | RP2040 GPIO / physical pin |
|---|---|
| Output permission: HIGH grants, LOW/reset/Hi-Z disables | GP2 / 4 |
| Driver SC/OVP active LOW; PD fault active HIGH | GP3 / 5; GP4 / 6 |
| RUN / FAULT LEDs, active HIGH | GP6 / 8; GP7 / 9 |
| I2C0 SDA / SCL, converter address 0x75 | GP0 / 2; GP1 / 3 |
| Current ADC0, nominal 0.2 V/A | GP26 / 38 |
| Output ADC1, divider 100k/20k | GP27 / 39 |
| Qualified PD input ADC2, divider 150k/22k | GP28 / 40 |
| PROGRAM VBUS ADC3, divider 15k/20k | GP29 / 41 |
| USB DM / DP via 27 Ω | Dedicated pins 46 / 47 |
| SWCLK / SWDIO / MCU_RUN | Pins 24 / 25 / 26 |
| BOOTSEL through 1 kΩ | QSPI_SS, pin 56 |

RUN first resets converter EN, verifies input and PD fault, releases EN with reset OE=0, writes and reads back every voltage/current/protection register, checks PD again, and writes OE=1 last. Any ADC conversion error or protective fault drives permission LOW. USB detach does not change PD operation.
